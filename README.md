## Information:
CFB Offense Analysis is an R project I developed to analyze the many facets of a college football offense.
It involves gathering data from the cfbfastR package, including play-by-play data for FBS schools.
Also included is [CFBD](https://collegefootballdata.com/) data again gathered via cfbfastR. A CFBD API Key is
needed which you can obtain for free [here](https://collegefootballdata.com/key).

The outputs include 10 data visualizations intended to provide context and insight for a
particular college football team's offensive usage, tendencies, efficiency, etc.
