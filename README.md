CFB Offense Analysis is an R script I developed to analyze college football offenses's multi-facted nature.
The script involves gathering data from the cfbfastR package, including play by play data for FBS schools.
Also included is C[CFBD](https://collegefootballdata.com/) data again gathered via cfbfastR.

The outputs include 10 data visualizations intended to provide context and insight for a
particular college football team's offensive usage, tendencies, efficiency, etc.
